## Your frame becomes unshakable

* Leaders must be the **anchor** in the partnership.
* Ballet strengthens posture and core, giving your partner steady guidance without wobbling or over-force.
* Picture this: you lead multiple spins in a crowded club, yet your body stays perfectly centered like a rock.

## Your lead becomes smoother and clearer

* Ballet builds **precision**—activating exactly the muscles you need, no extra tension.
* In Salsa & Bachata, that means **cleaner signals**: your partner feels direction without heavy pushing or pulling.
* After a few months, you’ll hear, *“Your lead feels so effortless.”*

## Your musicality and styling level up

* Ballet sharpens arm control, body lines, and foot placement.
* This doesn’t make you “look ballet” on the floor—it just gives you **elegant presence**.
* You’ll be able to hit accents with sharpness or flow with smoothness, depending on the music.

## You last longer on the floor

* Leaders burn more energy (initiating turns, supporting dips, moving across the floor).
* Ballet develops endurance in your legs and core, so you can dance **longer without fatigue**.

## You stand out as a leader

* Most leaders focus only on patterns.
* Ballet gives you **sharpness, smoothness, and balance** that instantly sets you apart.
* Followers will feel the difference even if they can’t explain why.
